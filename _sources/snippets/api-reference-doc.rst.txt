Here is how to create an API reference section, like https://www.diffpy.org/diffpy.utils/api/diffpy.utils.html:

- If your package can be imported as ``import <package_name>``, visit :ref:`faq-doc-api-standard`.

- If your package supports **namespace import**, like ``import <namespace_name>.<package_name>``, visit :ref:`faq-doc-api-namespace`.
